							Have you ever sneezed and then felt the urge to check what was just launched from your nostrils? For most it’s the typical milky-yellow mucus that clogs our airways. But for THEO, every sneeze is a tie died swirl of the colors of the rainbow, as if he has been snorting skittles and pixie sticks. This is the pleasantly disgusting result of hours spent engulfed in the colorful aerosol fumes of spray cans.

				<h3>The Vigilant Vandal</h3>
				<p>
					There's something about the spacing of railroad ties that makes it impossible to find a rhythm as you walk. No matter how short or long your stride you are bound to slip as you approach the iron giants waiting down the line.
				<br>
				<br>
					I've made the walk countless times, but still a knot of anticipation grows in my stomach as we draw closer to the freight trains, a mix of excitement, curiosity and nerves. Beside me THEO bounces along without a problem, as if he was made for this.
				<br>
				<br>
					You've probably seen his name emblazoned on walls and signs citywide. THEO, the vigilant vandal. In the past two years he has used spray paint and markers to leave his mark on the city of Eugene. There are booming bubble letters in the Whiteaker. billboard spots fifty feet in the air, and tags on every surface imaginable. There are also the colorful pieces on trains and trackside walls, all of which have made THEO a physical piece of the city. 
				<br>
				<br>
					Most people consider them criminals, others might grant them the title of artists, but ever since graffiti first sprouted from the South Bronx in the early 1970's the vandals have proudly referred to themselves as "writers". THEO, one of the many writers in Eugene, has found himself caught up in a volatile graffiti culture.
				<br>
				<br>
					"Sometimes graffiti is just the best, your up and your getting up and your meeting people and its awesome," Theo says. "And then it also sucks because it's on your mind constantly, it's a stress sometimes."
				<br>
				<br>
					Thanks to his passion and dedication THEO, whose real name is Donovan Rubio, experienced an impressive rise in this visible counter culture. What began two years ago as a hobby of self-expression has become a lifestyle, a love and an addiction. But the higher you climb, whether it is on billboards or rooftops, the further you have to fall.
				<br>
				<br>
					"I don't really want to know what's gonna happen to me in the end if I started doing this or that, or where my life's gonna end up and things like that. Fear of what's gonna happen in the future," Theo says. "When I started doing graffiti I lost that fear. It's a release and it's a good one."

				<h3>Graff Life</h3>
				<p>
					As we approach the line of freight cars THEO prepares himself. Finishing his beer, He pulls out a new can from his bag, a baby blue Rustoleum left over from yesterdays mission. 
				<br>
				<br>
					"When I pick up a can of paint its THEO," he explains. "THEO's like that little trouble maker and then Donovan is like that little good kid, and together they are that sweet and sour combo."
				<br>
				<br>
					Graffiti is a passion, a dangerous romance between adrenaline and creative expression. It is as much an art as it is a crime, produced at the expense of everyone involved. As a teen, graffiti is the perfect release for pent up pubescent frustration, a rebellious but creative outlet, and the perfect crime. 
				<br>
				<br>
					However, the vast majority of taggers are adults between eighteen and forty years old. They work jobs and pay bills, they have families and lead regular lives, but every now and then, in the dead of night, they take on a different persona. They become military strategists, meticulously planning missions and bombing the streets with back packs stacked with rattling cans.
				<br>
				<br>
					The first few freights are taken so Theo and I continue down the line.  As we walk Theo moves from car to car looking for any open panel space to toss up his name. About three quarters of the way down we strike gold, a newly built yellow T-Box sits just waiting for our arrival.
				<br>
				<br>
					"Ooohhh it's a freshy!" THEO exclaims, chuckling to himself about our good fortune. He is visibly giddy with excitement, like a kid at Disney land who has just seen Mickey Mouse in the flesh, "I'll take the right side."
				<br>
				<br>
					THEO sets to work, losing himself in his music and stretching towards the top of the car. Dancing through the latent aerosol fumes the letters begin to take shape. Known for going big, Theo's style lends its self to its imposing size. He climbs onto the freight car to get higher, producing letters bigger than himself. With wide barred letter forms and wild fills his pieces pop off the panels, a far cry from where he started just two years ago.	
				<br>
				<br>
					THEO and I got to know each other in a poetry class at the university of Oregon in the fall of 2012. I had come back from a summer vacation on the east coast to find his Theory tag on nearly every trashcan in the West University neighborhood. He had crushed it. 
				<br>
				<br>
					In class we would sit and draw and write rhymes and talk about how cute the grad student professor was. It was evident immediately that he had passion for the game. He was painting every night, staying up late and soaking up as much of the culture as he could. His skills were still developing for sure, He had poor letter structure and sloppy can control, what we writers would mockingly refer to as toy, but he had spirit. We began to hit the train yards together and acquaint our selves with Eugene’s graffiti scene. As my graffiti career was winding down, Donovan's was just taking off.
				<br>
				<br>
					I painted my fair share of graffiti once upon a time. On and off for a number of years, with various names and in several cities I "got up". Graffiti has most constructively acted as a release for stifled creative self-expression, and most destructively as a distraction and financial burden. But when you write three essays a week on subjects you could care less about, and spend your days surrounded by so many people just going through the motions, it becomes necessary to shake things up, to find some escape.
				<br>
				<br>
					Graffiti is about differentiating yourself from the crowd, even if it is just for your own recognition. Only a handful of people will recognize your tag for what it is, and even fewer will actually know who <i>you</i> are, but it lets you know who you are. 
				<br>
				<br>
					"People will catch on to your shit that don’t write, they might like it and they might not, but fuck 'em," Theo says. "I don’t do it for them if they don't like it, I’m not really doing it for people that do like it, I'm just doing it for me."
				<br>
				<br>
					Some writers do chose to chase the fame; that always seemed frivolous. If your goal is to be admired by a bunch of narcissistic and entitled artist types then by all means be my guests. But you are in it for the wrong reasons. Self fulfillment is what it's about, proving to yourself what you are capable of, we could care less about what other people think, that's why we write on their property.
