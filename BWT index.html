				<h3>The Vigilant Vandal</h3>
				<p>
					There's something about the spacing of railroad ties that makes it impossible to find a rhythm as you walk. No matter how short or long your stride you are bound to slip as you approach the iron giants waiting down the line.

					I’ve made the walk countless times, but still a knot of anticipation grows in my stomach as we draw closer to the freight trains, a mix of excitement, curiosity and nerves. Beside me Theo bounces along without a problem, as if he was made for this.

					You’ve probably seen his name emblazoned on walls and signs citywide. Theo, the vigilant vandal. In the past two years he has used spray paint and markers to leave his mark on the city of Eugene. There are booming bubble letters in the Whiteaker. billboard spots fifty feet in the air, and tags on every surface imaginable. There are also the colorful pieces on trains and trackside walls, all of which have made Theo a physical piece of the city. 

					Most people consider them criminals, others might grant them the title of artists, but ever since graffiti first sprouted from the South Bronx in the early 1970’s the vandals have proudly referred to themselves as “writers”. Theo, one of the many writers in Eugene, has found himself caught up in a volatile graffiti culture.

					“Sometimes graffiti is just the best, your up and your getting up and your meeting people and its awesome,” Theo says.  “And then it also sucks because it’s on your mind constantly, it’s a stress sometimes.”

					Thanks to his passion and dedication Theo, whose real name is Donovan Rubio, experienced an impressive rise in this visible counter culture. What began two years ago as a hobby of self-expression has become a lifestyle, a love and an addiction. But the higher you climb, whether it is on billboards or rooftops, the further you have to fall.

					“I don’t really want to know what’s gonna happen to me in the end if I started doing this or that, or where my life’s gonna end up and things like that. Fear of what’s gonna happen in the future,” Theo says. “When I started doing graffiti I lost that fear. It’s a release and it’s a good one.”
